# Bank-Management-System

#This is a simple C++ console application for managing bank accounts. The system allows users to:

#Create new accounts with a name and initial balance
#Deposit money into an account
#Withdraw money from an account
#Check the balance of an account
The application uses object-oriented programming principles with Account and Bank classes. All interactions are performed through a text-based menu in the terminal.
